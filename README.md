# Hangman-Game
Hangman Game (Developed in Python)
The Hangman game is a word-guessing challenge where the player attempts to figure out a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. The player must guess the word before the stick-figure hangman is completely drawn.

Game Features:
A word is selected at random for the player to guess.
The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses, and each wrong attempt draws part of the hangman.
Correct guesses reveal the position of the letters in the word.
The game ends when the player successfully guesses the word or when the hangman is fully drawn.
Technologies & Language:
This game was built entirely using Python, a versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Pythonâ€™s built-in functions and control structures make it ideal for developing interactive console-based games like Hangman.

The game uses:

Random module for selecting words.
Simple loops and conditionals to handle the game flow.
String manipulation for checking guesses and updating the word display.
Python was chosen for its ease of use and wide adoption, making it a perfect choice for developing a fun and educational project like this.
